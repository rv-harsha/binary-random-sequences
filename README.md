# Human vs Computer random sequences
Classify Human vs Computer generated random binary sequences. Perform PCA and arrive at conclusions based on results.

Use the file binary_random_20fa.hdf5. This file contains student generated sequences by students as well as an equal number of randomly generated numpy sequences. Use the data to construct the 20 x 20 sample correlation matrix matrix. Note: we converted the data from {0, 1} to +1 or -1.
